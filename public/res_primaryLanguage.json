      "description": "ðŸ‘‹Hello, My name is Dylan and I am a software developer, I have a background in aerospace production and sales, I have always been a problem solver, and when I learned that at every level of software development you are solving problems, and working in teams to make things smooth I knew it was for me. I decided to learn full stack software development so that I could be hands on in whatever step of the process I needed to be to ensure my team feels supported, I hope to use these skills to improve processes and morale within a team of hard working people. I think sales and working in production for so long gives me a high level of retention towards a positive attitude and my people skills really shine in every environment I put myself in.",
